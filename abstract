Traditionally, statistical communication has focused on
students' writing, specifically how they communicate
statistical ideas. While often overlooked, the code
students write during their data analysis communicates
important information about their thinking and learning.
In this presentation I will outline a framework for
analyzing students' code as a relic of their learning.
We will explore four different ways this framework
could be used to analyze students' code, with an eye
toward the understanding it communicates.
